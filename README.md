### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Matt and it's nice to digitally meet you! I'm a software engineer working in the healthcare space by day. Outside of my fulltime job, I love to contribute to side projects, tinker with new technologies, bake, grill, garden, read, etc. 😁

#### :construction: This profile is a WIP so please excuse the clutter as I compose myself. :construction:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [CLI tool built in Rust](https://github.com/ericb/gaze)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, SQLite, improving my PHP, taking nvim for a test drive (out of all of these, nvim is the trickiest to get used to but I recognize its power 😵‍💫)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on project with friendly devs who want to have fun building cool stuff 😎
- 🤔 Codewise, I’m not looking for help with anything particular at the moment, but I know that Rust is gonna kick me in the brain eventually. But if you are an nvim / vim user and want to drop some juicy tips then I'm all ears. 😁
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I was a teenager/young adult, I was the lead singer in a touring hardcore punk band 🤘
